                        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the 
                        meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to 
                        describe a web page's appearance/presentation <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">(CSS)</a> or 
                        functionality/behavior <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">(JavaScript)</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website 
                        or between websites. 
                        Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to 
                        pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

                <article class="content">
                    <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use 
                        to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags 
                        can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. 
                        For example, take the following line of content:
                    </p>
                    <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                    <p>
                        If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
                    </p>
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;&sol;p&gt;</code>

                    <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
                    <img src="Resources/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="p tag anatomy">
                    <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle 
                            brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. 
                            This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard 
                            beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
                    <img src="Resources/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="Attribute anatomy">
                    <p>
                        Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, <span class="special-text">class</span> is the 
                        attribute name and <span class="special-text">editor-note</span> is the attribute value. The <span class="special-text">class</span> attribute 
                        allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same <span class="special-text">class</span> value) with style information and other things.
                    </p>
                    <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
                        </li>    
                        <li>
                            The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                            The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                <article class="content">
                    <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, 
                        we could wrap the word "very" in a <span class="special-text">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;&sol;strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;&sol;p&gt;
                    </code>
                        <p>
                            You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the <span class="special-text">&lt;p&gt;</span> 
                            element first, then the <span class="special-text">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element; therefore, we have to close the <span class="special-text">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element first, then the 
                            <span class="special-text">&lt;p&gt;</span> element. The following is incorrect:</p>
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;&sol;p&gt;&lt;&sol;strong&gt;
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best 
                            guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!
                        </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Empty_elements">
                <header class="header-text">Empty elements</header>
                <article class="content">
                    <p>
                        Some elements have no content and are called <strong>empty elements</strong>. Take the <span class="special-text">&lt;img&gt;</span> element that we already have in our HTML page:
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        This contains two attributes, but there is no closing </img> tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to 
                        embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.
